# marp-GUI

[日本語](README.md) | **English**

An environment for building Marp slides **by touching and editing directly in the VS Code or Antigravity IDE preview while collaborating with AI**.
Your source stays plain Markdown. In the preview you can double-click text to fix it, right-click to pick a layout, and reorder slides.

Because plain Markdown is poured into CSS frameworks, **reusing past slides and maintaining consistent design reproducibility are effortless**. Without overhyping, for university faculty and researchers who prepare and reuse lectures and research talks every week, this workflow is genuinely transformative.

### Key Features
- Synced preview: shows the slide at your cursor side by side (click it to jump to that line in the source)
- Direct editing in the preview: double-click text → Enter writes it back to the source
- Layout variants: right-click a slide → compare options such as three cards or figure-and-text columns, and switch with one click
- Slide operations: add, duplicate, reorder, delete, and search for and insert existing slides
- 📄 PDF (vector, so text stays sharp) and ▶ Present (full screen in Chrome with presenter view & speech synthesis)

Works on macOS and Windows (the test suite also runs on Ubuntu). Node.js 20 or later.

> **Note:** The command titles and settings of the extensions are in English, but the buttons, menus and messages inside the preview are currently Japanese only, and screenshots may show Japanese labels. The sample deck `slides/sample-getting-started/` explains the workflow in English.

## What you can do

![A grid of finished slides from the sample deck "Hydrogen in the Earth's Core"](docs/img/en/07-slides.png)

You can make academic slides like these from ordinary Markdown. Above are some slides from the sample deck "Hydrogen in the Earth's Core".

![Six slides from the sample deck "Getting started with marp-GUI"](docs/img/en/08-getting-started.png)

The sample deck "Getting started with marp-GUI" (`slides/sample-getting-started/`, twelve slides, English) explains the workflow itself: direct editing, layout classes, slide operations, box editing, export and the lint. Open it first if you read English rather than Japanese.

![The synced preview, with the current slide marked by a blue frame](docs/img/en/01-overview.png)

This is the synced preview that opens on the right side of VS Code. When you move the cursor in the source (on the left), the preview moves to that slide and marks it with a blue frame. Slide buttons appear above it, and a bar for text size and color appears at the bottom.

---

## 1. What you need (install these first)

| Item | Where to get it / Requirement |
|---|---|
| **VS Code** or **Antigravity IDE** | https://code.visualstudio.com/ (+ AI coding plugin/agent) |
| **Paid AI Plan (Required)** | **Claude Pro (or higher)** or **Antigravity Pro (or higher)** subscription is required to collaborate with the AI on slides and CSS |
| **Node.js** (LTS version) | https://nodejs.org/en/download |
| **Google Chrome** (or Edge) | Used for vector PDF output and full-screen presenting |

## 2. Download

Click the green **"Code" button → "Download ZIP"** at the top of this page, then unzip it.
Move the unzipped folder (`marp-GUI-main`) to **a place where it can stay permanently**, such as your Documents folder. (If you leave it in Downloads and later delete it, the tools will stop working.)

If you use git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShohTagawa/marp-GUI.git
```

## 3. Install (one double-click)

| macOS | Windows |
|---|---|
| **Right-click → "Open"** on `install-mac.command` (first time only; choose "Open" if asked to confirm) | **Double-click** `install-windows.bat` (if you see "Windows protected your PC", click "More info" → "Run anyway") |

A black terminal window installs the required parts (a few minutes the first time), and at the end VS Code opens the sample slides.
If VS Code was already open, run **"Developer: Reload Window"** from the Command Palette (⌘⇧P / Ctrl+Shift+P).

If you are comfortable with the terminal, this one line in the folder does the same thing:

```bash
npm run setup
```

If you use an AI coding agent such as **Antigravity IDE** or **Claude Code**, you can also simply open the cloned `marp-GUI` folder and ask the agent in chat:

- **macOS**: **"Please install the tools in `tools`"**
- **Windows**: **"Please install and adapt the tools so they work on Windows"**

It will run the setup and link the extensions for your OS automatically.

> If you move the folder somewhere else, run the installer again (it re-creates the links that register the extensions with VS Code / Antigravity IDE).

## 4. Try it out

1. In VS Code, **open the `marp-GUI` folder** (File → Open Folder)
2. Open `slides/sample-getting-started/sample-getting-started.md` (an English deck; `slides/sample-layouts/sample-layouts.md` shows every layout class, in Japanese)
3. Press **⌘K M** (Windows: **Ctrl+K M**) to open the synced preview on the right

| To do this | Do this |
|---|---|
| Open the home (recent / shelves / most-edited / search) | **⌘K H** (Windows: **Ctrl+K H**), or **🏠 Marp** in the status bar |
| Fix text | **Double-click** text in the preview → type → **Enter** (Esc cancels) |
| Change the layout | **Right-click** a slide in the preview → choose an option |
| Add, duplicate, move, or delete slides | Buttons at the top right of the slide (＋ ⧉ ↑ ↓ 🗑) |
| Insert existing slides between slides | The **＋** that appears when you hover between slides |
| Move or resize a box | **Alt (Option on macOS) + click** → drag |
| Make a PDF | **📄 PDF** in the status bar at the bottom (output goes to the `out/` folder) |
| Present | **▶ Present** in the status bar (F = full screen / P = presenter view / ←→ = next/previous page) |
| Undo | ⌘Z / Ctrl+Z |

### Fix text

![Double-clicking text in the preview and editing it in place](docs/img/en/02-direct-edit.png)

Double-click text in the preview to retype it in place. Press Enter to confirm, and only that part of the source is rewritten.

### Change the layout

![Right-clicking a slide shows layout options as thumbnails](docs/img/en/03-layouts.png)

Right-click a slide to see thumbnails of the same content arranged in different ways. Choosing one changes only one line in the source (`_class`).

> The layout suggestions are tuned for Japanese text. With long English bullets, fewer layouts (or none) may be offered.

### Add, duplicate, move, or delete slides

![Add, duplicate, move, and delete buttons at the top right of the selected slide](docs/img/en/04-slide-buttons.png)

Buttons appear at the top right of the slide you select in the preview. You can add a new slide, duplicate, move it earlier or later, or delete it.

### Insert existing slides

![Clicking the ＋ between slides opens a popup for choosing existing slides](docs/img/en/05-insert-popup.png)

Hover between two slides and a ＋ appears. Click it to search slides in your other decks and insert one at that position.

### Move or resize a box

![A box selected with Alt (Option) + click, showing a frame and resize handles](docs/img/en/06-box-edit.png)

Hold Alt (Option on macOS) and click to put a frame around a box. Drag to move it, and use the corner handles to resize it.

For the full list of operations and detailed settings, see [tools/marp-scroll-sync/README.md](tools/marp-scroll-sync/README.md) (in Japanese).

## 5. Make your own slides

The easiest way is to copy a whole sample folder and rename it.

```
slides/
  my-talk/            ← make the folder name
    my-talk.md        ← and the .md name match
    src/              ← put images here; refer to them from the .md as ./src/fig01-xxx.png
    out/              ← PDFs and other output go here
  assets/             ← images shared by several decks, such as logos
```

- Use **only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens** in file names (full-width characters and spaces cause broken links)
- For the logo, replace `slides/assets/logo-placeholder.png`, or change the image in `header:` at the top of the .md
- For the photo on the title slide, replace `slides/assets/profile-placeholder.png`

### How to write the source (minimal)

```markdown
---
marp: true
theme: tsutawaru-simple
paginate: true
size: 16:9
footer: ''
---

<!-- _class: lay-cards3 -->

## Heading

- **First**
  Explanation
- **Second**
  Explanation
- **Third**
  Explanation

<div class="takeaway">The one thing this slide should say</div>
```

- Slides are separated by `---` (with a blank line before and after)
- Adding one word of **layout class**, such as `<!-- _class: lay-cards3 -->`, changes the arrangement (the right-click layout options rewrite this).
  See `sample-layouts.md` for the available layouts and `sample-parts.md` for the parts
- The key-point band at the bottom is `<div class="takeaway">…</div>`

### Key Idea: Pouring Plain Markdown into CSS Frameworks

Built on top of MIT-licensed [Marp (Marpit)](https://marp.app/), `marp-GUI` puts **ordinary Markdown inside CSS frameworks (`theme/*.css`) with slide structures organized into CSS classes**:

- **Effortless reuse & design reproducibility**: Because the header, slide title, and bottom takeaway band (`.takeaway`) are fixed in CSS and slide structures (three cards, step-by-step flows, side-by-side figures, tables, etc.) are divided into CSS classes, you can switch layouts without touching the Markdown body. Past slides inserted via the `＋` button automatically match your current deck's CSS theme.
- **Ask the AI to create new CSS themes**: Beyond tweaking spacing on a single page, you can show a reference and tell the AI **"Build a CSS theme in this style"** — it will generate a new `theme/*.css` for you.
- **Separate human edits and AI edits in Git to continuously improve performance**: Every GUI gesture in the preview (double-clicking text, right-clicking to pick a layout, `Alt`+dragging a box) writes back to the Markdown source as a single Undo step (`⌘Z` / `Ctrl+Z`). **By separating commits made by the AI from commits where you manually refined the slides**, your `git diff` history captures your exact preferences — feeding those diffs back into your AI skills makes slide generation smarter over time.
- **Minimal starter skills included (designed to grow with you)**: This public release includes only a minimal baseline set of the author's skills and themes. It may feel simple at first, but it is designed to be grown into your own custom environment through your Git history and CSS styles.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Practical Notes

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| **Slides or presentation do not display (especially on macOS)** | On macOS, if the folder is placed in a directory where **Google Chrome lacks file access permission** (such as `Desktop` or `Downloads`), Chrome may fail to load the slides or images. Move the folder to a permitted location or grant Chrome access under **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Files and Folders** (or ask the AI to fix it). |
| **Garbled characters or broken fonts in exported PDF** | Depending on your OS, required fonts (such as `BIZ UDPGothic`) may not be installed. Simply tell the AI: **"Fix the garbled font in the PDF for my OS"** and it will adjust the font settings. |
| ⌘K M does not open the preview / the buttons are missing | Run the installer again → "Developer: Reload Window" in VS Code / Antigravity IDE |
| 📄 / ▶ do not appear | Check that the .md starts with `marp: true`, and that the editor has the **marp-GUI folder** open |
| PDF stops with "Printing failed" | In a terminal, run `npm run pdf:safe -- slides/<deck>/<deck>.md` (splits the job into smaller pieces) |
| "Node.js not found" | After installing Node.js, reopen the editor and run the installer again |
| You want to check the setup | `npm run setup:check` |

> **Questions & Community Contributions**: It is uncertain whether the author can personally answer every question, so we warmly welcome and look forward to answers, fixes, and improvements shared within the community via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

## 7. Using it from the terminal (optional)

```bash
npm run pdf      -- slides/<deck>/<deck>.md   # vector PDF (no argument = the deck you edited last)
npm run present  -- slides/<deck>/<deck>.md   # full-screen presentation in Chrome
npm run png      -- slides/<deck>/<deck>.md   # every page as PNG
npm run lint     -- slides/<deck>             # checks for too many boxes, too much text, etc.
```

## 8. Tests (for developers)

The synced-preview extension ships its test suite in `tools/marp-scroll-sync/test/`, run by Node's built-in test runner.

```bash
npm test
```

- The pure-logic tests (slide splitting, source mapping, slide operations, folding, library, index, layout variants, home screen) use only the three sample decks in `slides/` (`sample-layouts`, `sample-parts`, `sample-lecture`).
- The tests that drive the real preview (direct editing, box editing and cropping, gallery, end-to-end flows) need a local Google Chrome and `puppeteer-core` (installed by `npm install`). If Chrome is not found, only those tests are skipped.
- 346 tests in total (one, which writes a mock-up of the folded editor, is skipped unless `FOLDED_VIEW_OUT` is set); about 5 minutes with a local Chrome (files run one at a time, because some tests measure timing budgets).
- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) runs the same suite on macOS, Windows and Ubuntu with Node 20 and 22 (the timing-budget tests are skipped on shared runners).
- The sample deck `sample-lecture` is a fictional lecture deck that gathers the structures the tests rely on (an HTML table, inline SVG, a QR column, slides with and without `_class`).
- `npm run bench` measures the time from a gesture to the repainted preview on the same harness (results: [docs/benchmark.md](docs/benchmark.md)); `npm run screenshots` re-takes the screenshots in `docs/img/`; `npm run demo:ranking` builds a small temporary git repository and shows how the library ranks slides by their revision history.

The VS Code extensions are not installed through the Marketplace. Instead, this folder is registered (linked) into `~/.vscode/extensions/` (and `~/.antigravity-ide/extensions/` for Antigravity IDE). To remove them, delete `marp-gui.scroll-sync` and `marp-gui.pdf` from that folder (they are links, so the files in this folder are not deleted).

## Design Background & Acknowledgments

### To Marp (Yuki Hattori & Marp Team)

`marp-GUI` is built on top of **[Marp (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem)](https://marp.app/)** (`@marp-team/marp-core`, `@marp-team/marpit`, and `@marp-team/marp-cli`), created and maintained by **[Yuki Hattori (@yhatt)](https://github.com/yhatt)** and the **[Marp Team](https://github.com/marp-team)** under the MIT License. We are deeply grateful for their work in creating and maintaining such a clean, extensible foundation for building slides with Markdown and CSS.

### To Satoshi Nakajima

This project and our workflow for generating videos and avatars from slides were started after gaining inspiration and insight from articles in **Satoshi Nakajima's ([@snakajima](https://x.com/snakajima) / Receptron)** newsletter. In addition, the avatar synthesis in our on-demand lecture video pipeline has received tremendous inspiration and benefit from **[AvatarScript](https://github.com/receptron/avatarscript)** and **[MulmoCast](https://github.com/receptron/mulmocast-cli)** released as open source by Satoshi Nakajima (along with shinshin86's **[Mesh Avatar Studio](https://x.com/shinshin86/status/2106593371762651346)**).

### To Google DeepMind

The use of Antigravity (Argon) in this research and development is generously supported by **Google DeepMind's researcher support**. We are deeply grateful for their support.

### AI Models Used in Development

Almost all of the coding for this tool (extensions, scripts, CSS themes, and automated tests) as well as the creation of this README, documentation, and walkthrough videos was done using AI:

- **Design**: GPT-5, GPT-5.1
- **Implementation & README/Docs**: GPT-5, GPT-5.1, Claude Opus (4.5 / 4.6 / 4.7), Gemini (via Claude Code / Antigravity IDE)
